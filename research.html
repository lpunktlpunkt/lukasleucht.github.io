                  Why do politicians often rely on patronage, instead of selecting the most qualified applicants for public employment? Does patronage deliver an electoral return? I combine newly digitized personnel records on the selection and performance of 5,795 New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers with geolocated information on all voters and election results in the city for 1900-1916. Linking the results of civil service exams with complete lists of NYPD employees reveals that 21% of patrolmen hired in the period lacked the required test scores. These patronage employees were more likely to be connected to the leaders of Tammany Hall, the city's incumbent Democratic Party organization at the time. I use a difference-in-differences design around the entrance date of patronage recruits to estimate the electoral return to patronage jobs. Patronage resulted in a 13.9% increase in registered Democratic voters within a 50 meter radius around the employee's address. This electoral response <span>&#8212;</span> and complementary results <span>&#8212;</span> suggest that patronage employees reciprocated by mobilizing the votes of their neighbors. These private electoral benefits of patronage came with public costs: Patronage employees performed considerably worse than their meritocratically selected peers. I provide suggestive evidence that these costs were exacerbated by an electorally motivated pattern of promotions, which sustained the <i> quid pro quo </i> relationship.

                <p> <p align="justify"> Using newly collected data on death rates and aerial victories of more than 5,000 German fighter pilots during World War II, we examine the effects of public recognition on performance and risk-taking. When a particular pilot is honoured publicly, both the victory rate and the death rate of his former peers increase. Fellow pilots react more if they come from the same region of Germany, or if they worked closely with him. Our results suggest that personal rivalry can be a prime motivating force, and that non-financial rewards can lead to a crowd-in of both effort and risk-taking via social connections.</p>

                <p> <p align="justify"> We evaluate the role of taxes on trade in the development of imperial Britain’s fiscal-military state. Influential work, e.g., Brewer’s (1989) "Sinews of Power," attributed increased fiscal capacity to the taxation of domestic, rather than traded, goods: excise revenues, coarsely associated with domestic goods, grew faster than customs revenues. We construct new historical revenue series disaggregating excise revenues from traded and domestic goods. We find substantial growth in taxes on traded goods, accounting for over half of indirect taxation around 1800. This challenges the conventional wisdom attributing the development of the British state to domestic factors: international factors mattered, too.
